### About blog

It is kind of personal, I'm going to be writing only about topics that are interesting to me and probably outside of any fixed schedule so don't expect it.
If there is a new post, I will mention it on my twitter so preferably check there for updates. This blog is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [github](https://pages.github.com/).

### Who am I?

My name is Michael. On the internet most people know me by 'Revinder' hence the name of this page. Currently working as a backend engineer and spending my free time doing whatever I want. My academic background is Computer Science and that's all you need to know. I'm mostly interested in:
* **IT related** topics, whether its systems programming, security or game design. Always fun to find exploits and dissect how they work.

* **Gaming/Esport** - specifically those that have competetive aspect to them, I've always was about pushing the limits and minimaxing everything. This allowed me to be on top of the game no matter the genre. Games are huge part of my life and I've played them since I was 3 years old (yeah I know lol). Though I haven't found huge successes in my esport journey, I did try and compete on every opportunity. These are the titles that I spent majority of my time on:

    - World of Warcraft
    - League of Legends
    - Diablo 2
    - Underlords/TFT

* **Movies/TV Series** - less than original but I can't help myself. I'm always drawn towards good shows and movies. If you have any hidden gems let me know! I keep scheduled list of what to watch next and given initial interest, I will add it to it! There is no limit to genre - it can be anything.

* **Music** - pretty much the same deal as movies and tv series ;).
